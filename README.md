Script in python to download musics from Chauthan using Jdownloader2

Requiriments:

  Python Selenium
  Chrome

How it works:

  The "lista_chau.py" is a script to list all download links and write them to a .txt file from a selected letter.
  "download_chau.py" is the script to list all music from a download link (writed before in the "lista" script") and, again, write all download links on another .txt file.
  Them you can pick the "musica.txt" and drop in on the Jdownloader2 to download all the musics from an album.
